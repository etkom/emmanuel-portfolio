# Emmanuel's portfolio website

## Description

This is a webpage to showcase my abilities and portfolio. It is a platform to showcase my skills and potential to recruiters, human resource personnel and industry colleagues.

Creating this webpage wasn't straightforward as i had to recreate a jpeg mockup whilst adding my own twist to it

The homepage contain snippets of all the content on the page. You can visit other pages from the Navigation links. The pages include:
- About Me
- Work
- Contact Me
- Resume

## Usage

On the header at the top of the page, there's a logo ("Emmanuel") at the top left corner that can take you back to the homepage from anywhere you are on the website.
